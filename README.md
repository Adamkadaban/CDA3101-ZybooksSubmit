# CDA3101-ZybooksSubmit
Script for submitting grades from zybooks to canvas

- `student_mapping.csv` is a file that was semi-manually generated by going to the gradebook on canvas and exporting all the grades.
	- I've removed everything but the sid and email, as other content isn't necessary for this script
	- See [here](https://support.canvas.fsu.edu/kb/article/1524-how-can-i-easily-get-a-list-of-my-students-email-addresses-in-canvas/)
